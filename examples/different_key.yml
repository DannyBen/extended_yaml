# Load this file with
#
#   ExtendedYAML.load 'master.yml', key: 'include'
#
# By default, ExtendedYAML is looking for a key names 'extends'.
# You can use any other key by providing it as a parameter to
# ExtendedYAML.load.
# Note that the provided key will also be used in all loaded files.
include:
# this file uses 'extends' still, so it will not be extended any further
- subdir/deep
# this file uses the proper 'include' key, so it should be extended futher
- subdir/deep_include

override: will be overridden
